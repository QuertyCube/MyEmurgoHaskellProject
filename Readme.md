# How To Run My Bouncing Ball Project





Run the project with

```bash
cabal run
```

## Example of input in program

```
Enter Start Velocity (1,2,...): 
1
Enter Max Velocity: 
5
Enter Size Frame (width): 
700
Enter Size Frame (height): 
800
Enter added speed when the ball bounces:

```

after the program runs, it will write a log to the terminal and also to "log.txt" which records the x and y positions of the ball when it bounces
